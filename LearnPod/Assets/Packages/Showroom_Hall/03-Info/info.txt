To use the post processing : juste download the post processing stack on the asset store,
it's free! 

Then just go in the 04-Post-Processing Profile folder to find the profile I used and link it to your camera.

You can drag and drop the prefab directly into your scene or use the scene exemple_day or night.

Optimisation :
The lights are in realtime, if you want better performances you may use the baking option (click on the
lights and then change the mode from realtime to baked), you can also change the resolution of the textures in the import options 
(click on the texture and change the max size, you can also change the compression and use the crunch compression).
